                <p>
                    This project proposes a software-based AI-driven system to optimize urban traffic flow. Using real-time traffic data, the system dynamically adjusts traffic light timings, predicts congestion patterns, and provides actionable insights for city planners. The solution integrates machine learning models with visualization tools, creating a scalable and fully software-driven solution that aligns with smart city initiatives.

                <h2>Core Logic: Real-Time Adaptive Control</h2>
                <p>The most advanced version of this system operates on a fully dynamic, real-time logic that uses live video analysis to manage traffic. It moves beyond fixed timers to create an intelligent control loop that continuously adapts to changing traffic conditions.</p>
                
                <div class="logic-steps">
                    <div class="logic-step">
                        <h3>1. Real-Time Video Analysis</h3>
                        <p>The system processes four independent video feeds, one for each lane of the intersection. Using a pre-trained <strong>YOLO (You Only Look Once)</strong> object detection model, it identifies and classifies all vehicles within each feed in real-time, providing a continuous stream of data on traffic composition.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="logic-step">
                        <h3>2. Weighted Vehicle Prioritization</h3>
                        <p>Each detected vehicle is assigned a "weight" based on its type to determine its priority. For example, an ambulance is given a high weight (e.g., 10) to ensure immediate passage, while a bus or truck has a higher weight than a standard car. This ensures that emergency services and high-occupancy vehicles are prioritized, improving public safety and transport efficiency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="logic-step">
                        <h3>3. Dynamic Green Light Calculation</h3>
                        <p>The total weight for each lane is calculated by summing the weights of all its waiting vehicles. The duration of the green light is then made directly proportional to this total weight, ensuring that lanes with heavier traffic or high-priority vehicles are cleared effectively. The system enforces a minimum (e.g., 5 seconds) and maximum green time to maintain flow and prevent indefinite waits.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="logic-step">
                        <h3>4. Intelligent Lane Switching & Optimization</h3>
                        <p>After an initial calibration period, the system grants the green light to the lane with the highest traffic weight. To optimize performance, the system only processes the video feed for the active (green) lane. When the green light cycle ends, the system intelligently selects the next lane to go green based on which of the waiting (red light) lanes has accumulated the highest traffic weight.</p>
